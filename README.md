# DreamTeamManagement

Dream Team Management is a full stack content management system app that allows users to create departments for their business, assign each department a manager, and add employees to those departments along with their roles and description of their roles. Users may create an account with an email address and password and use those credentials to log into the app.

The technologies used in this project were node.js to install the necessary packages, express.js to run the server, MySQL for the database, Sequelize to create the database models, handlebars.js for the templates, passport.js for authenticating logins and maintaining sessions, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive functionality.
